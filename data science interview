In Sept 2021, I applied for a Data Science position. I thought some questions were interesting and want to keep record of them for the future. 
-------------------
Describe a specific situation in which you had to apply strong knowledge of SQL query language against a variety of data sets. 

I have one thousand hours training with Python/SQL manipulation, but mostly using Python. At Illinois State University, I invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that compares thousands of data transactions to 
Access (SQL) database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error. When Dr. Walstrom the director of Python for 
Data Science saw my project, he indirectly told me to apply for this job. I am currently taking two SQL courses, one at Illinois State University and one on Udemy. 
On my "Amazon" site, I had a basic search and recommendation section, but got recruited for a Python Data Analyst job so I had to quit the project to focus on my Python studies.
I am currently trying to understand SQL data manipluation because it is important when datasets get too complex or big.

I am referring to the following SQL/Python code when referring to those these above projects:

--------------------
Please detail where you gained knowledge of statistics and machine learning

Using portfolio123 is machine learning, by using a database of complex finance formulas to predict future returns. 
During my MBA program as an ISU graduate assistant, I generated a 95% to 99% r-squared using data analytics/science (depends on adjustment to overfitting). 
This identified the best candidates that would most likely successfully graduate at ISU. This was the final MBA capstone course, MQM497. 
Statitics was used all the time in my Data Science bootcamp:

---------------------
Please describe a complex predictive model that you have developed

At Douglas Capital Management, we used a portfolio123 database to use hundreds of finance formulas to predict future returns. For instance,
 OperCashFlTTM - CapExTTM + IntExpTTM*(1-TaxRate%TTMInd/100) would be inserted into a database with a hundred other formulas to see which formula is the 
most relavant. Basic MATLAB functions would be used to help find the statistic relevance of each formula. In 2019 of Q4, our returns for our agressive trading 
were in the top 10. 

---------------------
What are the tools you have most commonly used to complete predictive analysis? 

I have mostly used Pandas and Numpy which was used in my Data Science Python bootcamp. This is also the packages that were used at Clark Street Capital 
and Douglas Capital Management:
