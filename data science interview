In Sept 2021, I applied for a Data Science position. Here is a list of the questions/answers:
---------------------------
Describe a specific situation in which you had to apply strong knowledge of SQL query language against a variety of data sets. 
 
I have one thousand hours training with Python/SQL data manipulation, but mostly using Python. For me personally, I find it easier to use SQL to extract the database and then use
Python to manipulate data sets. For example, at Illinois State University, I invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that compares 
thousands of data transactions to Access (SQL) database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error. When Dr. Walstrom the director of Python for 
Data Science saw my project, he indirectly told me to apply for this job. See code for reference: https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/AccountingAutomation

On my "Amazon" site, I had a basic SQL search and recommendation section using a variety of select and insert statements. I am currently improving SQL data manipluation7
because it is important when datasets get too complex or big. For example, Excel has a max of around two million rows while Python can have a max out on memory with very large,
complex dataFrame. See code for reference: https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Amazon-like-site

I am currently taking two SQL courses, one at Illinois State University and one on Udemy. Currently, I am learning to use TABLEAU connect, calculate, and visualize to can create graphs, charts, reports, dashboards. The goal is to help users project their data by offering a huge variety of data visualization tools to choose from.
Pre-procressing on a database level has better performance. I am also using Leetcode to improve my SQL programming skills.

----------------------
Please detail where you gained knowledge of statistics and machine learning

Using portfolio123.com is machine learning, by using a database of complex finance formulas to predict future returns. 
During my MBA program as an ISU graduate assistant, I generated a 95% to 99% r-squared using data analytics/science (depends on adjustment to overfitting). 
This identified the best candidates that would most likely successfully graduate at ISU. This was the final MBA capstone course, MQM497. 

Statitics was used all the time in my Data Science bootcamp, but I mostly focused on the Python sections because my teacher told me to:

------------------------
Please describe a complex predictive model that you have developed

At Douglas Capital Management, we used a portfolio123 database to use hundreds of finance formulas to predict future returns. For instance,
 OperCashFlTTM - CapExTTM + IntExpTTM*(1-TaxRate%TTMInd/100) would be inserted into a database with a hundred other formulas to see which formula is the 
most relavant. Basic MATLAB functions would be used to help find the statistic relevance of each formula. In 2019 of Q4, our returns for our agressive trading 
were in the top ten. However, I believe in Efficient Market theory and that more risk equals greater returns, so I have left the investment industry. I admit I am not smarter 
than the stock market on a buy and hold strategy.


------------------------
What are the tools you have most commonly used to complete predictive analysis? 

At Illinois State University, we used JMP Â® Pro Predictive to predict who would likely be the best students to graduate at Illinois State University. 

I Python imports such as used Numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot as imports which was used in my Data Science Python bootcamp.
I mostly used pandas dataFrames at Clark Street Capital and Douglas Capital Management.
