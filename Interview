1. How does this position fit with the career path you envision for yourself?
I want to improve my Python skills where I can become as strong as a Python programmer as Arafath Hossain, a current Data Sciencist at ISU.
His recent pell grant project on GitHub he voluntarily made is one of the most amazing things I have seen in the past few months, and I want to be like him.
I will not be leaving the data science position in the next six years because I will want to get my ten-year pension. 
This makes me the best long-term investment for the position.
Illinois State University is home to me as a former, current, and future student.

2. Data extrapolation and analysis are critical to accurate models being developed.  Please describe an example of data extract and analysis that you have completed.
At Illinois State University, I invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that 
compares thousands of data transactions to database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error: 
https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/AccountingAutomation

This in itself was a very important task because it involves accounting. If the program is not 100% accurate, one could
get involved in an audit that could cost the company thousands of dollars and a bad reputation. In accounting, one must be exact.
There are no guesses or predictions. Accuracy and attention to detail is of highest importance.


3. Please describe the experience you have creating predictive models.

At Douglas Capital Management, I used portfolio123.com database with hundreds of finance formulas to predict future returns. For instance,
 OperCashFlTTM - CapExTTM + IntExpTTM*(1-TaxRate%TTMInd/100) would be inserted into a database with an optimization process to see how this one 
 formula can affect future returns. We also had to account for missing and/or overfitting data. 
Basic MATLAB functions would be used to help find the statistic relevance of each formula. 
In 2019, our returns for our aggressive trading returns were in the top ten. 

During my MBA program as an ISU graduate assistant, I generated a 95% r-squared using data analytics (depends on adjustment to overfitting). 
This identified the best candidates that would most likely successfully graduate at ISU. This was the final MBA capstone course, MQM497. 
In conclusion, Pell Grants and amount of initiated contacts are the two biggest factors in whether a student enrolled at the university or not. 
These two factors alone can make a fairly good prediction on whether a student enrolls at the university or not. 
In conclusion, neural networks show that undecided majors, Pell Grant, distance from ISU, # of initiated events, family income median, total consumer expenditures, 
high school low income percentage, and high school GPA are the major factors in whether a student enrolls at Illinois State University or not. 
The test confirms that ACT, GPA, major, Pell Grant, and # of initiated events make a significant difference in students enrolling at Illinois State University.  

At Clark Street Capital, I used basic machine learning and correlations to predict loan risk. 
My "Amazon" website has a basic recommendation system that would predict what purchases the customer might want to buy next.


4. In terms of SQL syntax or query structure, what are some things you focus on when writing a query to ensure it functions as efficiently as possible?

Coding efficiency, queries, and data manipulation is my strength as I have over one thousand hours in data maniuplation which can be viewed on both GitHub and YouTube.
One must not just code, but code in the correct order and logic. My data manipulation skills can be viewed here:
https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler-Python
https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/LeetCode

On my "Amazon" site, I built an entire SQL database that was on the backend. It is connected on the frontend using PHP. 
The basic SQL terminology were all used for this project (i.e. select, insert, update, delete). 
In addition, it has a basic SQL search and recommendation section. All these SQL queries happened with high performance speed.
See code for reference: https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Amazon-like-site


Excel has a max of around two million rows while Python can have a max out on memory with very large, complex dataFrame. 
However, having rows at this mangitude does not happen often. I would imagine this could happen at an enormous company like Amazon.
Therefore, Python cam be used as a query langauge as that is what Python was designed to do.

My three SQL courses can be viewed here:

5. Part of the Data Scientist role will be to provide visualizations that will be able to explain the analysis that you have performed. 
What tools have you used to create data visualizations?  
I have mostly used Tablaeu and Excel for visualations. In a recent data science
poll on LinkedIn I saw Excel was ranked as being "highly underated" for data science. Because I have a webdevelopment background,
I could also easily display graphs on the Illinois State University website if needed. I have used API's with Javascript such
as https://www.chartjs.org/docs that are easy to implement.



6. Please describe a presentation that you have completed to present the results of a predictive model you developed.
At Illinois State University, I Invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that 
compares thousands of data transactions to database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error: 
https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/AccountingAutomation

I have presented this project to several programming professors and directors because I have wanted to try to implement my 
program on a more frequent and global basis. I truly believe my program can save ISU over a hundred thousand dollars a year if correctly implemented. 
It will also make the life of an accountant more enjoyable. 


7. Have you ever had to “sell” an idea to your co-workers, supervisor or customers? How did you do it?  
Great question! I think my data science accounting automation software I have developed would save Illinois State University, 
if inmplemented correctly, well over a hunrdred thousand dollars a year. But I have not had the confidence to "sell" my idea yet.

When I did invent my automation program, I did request permission to use the data first. I also made sure that no confidential information
would accidently be leaked. I also had a prototype using fake data built before hand so I had very high confidence the program would work.
I am always prepared and professional.


8. During analysis, how do you treat missing values?
If there was only some missing data, one could easily use a Python script to delete values that do not have data. 
A third choice is to simply fill the missing data with a 0. However, this can easily disort the data.
Most commonly, is one can use predicitive scores to get an "average" of what the missing data probably is using a 
simple regression line. This is the best common practice but can also take the most time.

Lastly, if there is not a lot of data points with lots of missing data, one should consider not using that data at all. 
For instance, when analyzing microcap stocks at Douglas Capital Management 
using portfolio123.com, sometimes there was not a lot of data points for certain financial formulas.
When one would plot the data, it was obvious because the graph would have "buckets" that were completely missing. 
These formulas were then removed completely from the optimization process.


9. What are the tools you have most commonly used to complete predictive analysis?  Which one is your favorite?   
Python Pandas dataFrame is by far my favorite tool. It is what I used to automate accounting anaytics predictions at Illinois State University,
financial automation at Douglas Capital Management, and predictive anaytics at Clark Street Capital. 
I also love using Tablaeu because it is simple to use and has been well adapted by Salesforce. Tablaeu gives a data scientist
an easy way to explain data to an individual who may not have a statistics and coding background.


First off, hello Kevin! Long time no see since being in the ISU MBA program together. 
Taking this job means more to me than simply moving numbers around virtually with Python/SQL. 
I hope taking the Python Data Science position gives inspiration for every ISU student to graduate because I too am an ISU graduate. 
On my first-year anniversary as a Python data scientist, I plan to donate 3% of my first year's salary to an ISU Python student as a scholarship.
