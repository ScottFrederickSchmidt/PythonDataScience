First off, hello Kevin! Long time no see since being in the ISU MBA program together. 
Six years ago, I joined the ISU MBA program as a graduate assistant. 
Taking this job means more to me than simply moving numbers around virtually with Python/SQL. 
I hope taking this position gives hope to every ISU student that with hard work, dedication and getting their degree from ISU, one can achieve anything. 
On my first-year anniversary as a Python Data Scientist, I plan to donate 3% of my first year's salary to an ISU Python/CS student as I too am an ISU graduate. 

1. How does this position fit with the career path you envision for yourself?
I hope to receive this position with no intention of leaving Illinois State University as an employer.
It is where I am a former, current, and future student, and ISU is home to me. 
I will not be leaving in the next six years because I plan to get my ten-year pension. 
This makes me the best long-term investment for the position.
Before starting the position, I plan to finish a Udemy Data Science bootcamp.
Over my two weeks off in December, I plan on doing over a hundred hours of machine learning coding 
puzzles from AlgoExpert.io. At some point, I plan on taking statistic classes at Illinois State University because I do realize I may have co-workers with 
a master’s degree in statistics. I want to be able to be a team player and better understand their role. 


2. Data extrapolation and analysis are critical to accurate models being developed.  Please describe an example of data extract and analysis that you have completed.
At Illinois State University, I Invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that 
compares thousands of data transactions to database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error:

This in itself was a very important task because it involves accounting. If the program is not 100% accurate, one could
get involved in an audit that could cost the company thousands of dollars and a reputation. In accounting, one must be exact.
There are no guesses or predictions. Accuracy and attention to detail is of highest importance.


3. Please describe the experience you have creating predictive models.



4. In terms of SQL syntax or query structure, what are some things you focus on when writing a query to ensure it functions as efficiently as possible?
Performance and strict programming is my strength. I have over one thousand hours in data maniuplation which can be viewed on both GitHub and YouTube.
One must not just code, but code in the correct order. LeetCode taught me how to do this. My data manipulation skills can be viewed here:




5. Part of the Data Scientist role will be to provide visualizations that will be able to explain the analysis that you have performed. 
What tools have you used to create data visualizations?   I have mostly used Tablaeu and Excel for visualations. In a recent data science
poll on LinkedIn I saw Excel was ranked as being "highly underated" for data science. Because I have a webdevelopment background,
I could also easily display graphs on the Illinois State University website if needed. I have used API's with Javascript such
as https://www.chartjs.org/docs that are easy to implement. 


6. Please describe a presentation that you have completed to present the results of a predictive model you developed.
At Illinois State University, I Invented a Python data science pandas dataFrame automation program that 
compares thousands of data transactions to database records which detects unbalanced accounts, new transactions, and human error: 
https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/AccountingAutomation

I have presented this project to several coding professors and directors because I have wanted to try to implement my 
program on a more global basis. I truly believe my program can save a hundred thousand dollars a year. 
It will also make the life of an accountant more enjoyable. However, I have not completely figured out how to do this
and would love the data science team to potentially help me. 


7. Have you ever had to “sell” an idea to your co-workers, supervisor or customers? How did you do it?  
Great question! I think my data science accounting automation software I have developed would save Illinois State University, 
if inmplemented, but I have not had the confidence to "sell" my idea yet. Right now, I am still relatively new to the university, so I am trying
to build up a better reputation before trying to implement such a big process.

When I did invent my automation program, I did request permission to use the data first. I also made sure that no confidential information
would accidently be leaked. I also had a simple prototype built before hand so I had very high confidence the program would work.
I always come prepared so I always look professional. I did not want to look silly if I spent ten hours on a Python project for it to only
to not work.


8. During analysis, how do you treat missing values?
First off, if there is not a lot of data, one should consider not using that data. For instance, when analyzing microcap stocks at Douglas Capital Management 
using portfolio123.com, sometimes there was not a lot of data for more unusually common financial formulas. When one would plot the data, it was obvious
because the graph would have "buckets" that were completely missing. 

If there was only some missing data, one could easily use a Python script to delete values that do not have data. 
A third choice is to simply fill the missing data with a 0. However, this can easily disort the data.
Most commonly, is one can use predicitive scores to get an "average" of what the missing data probably is using a 
simple regression line. This is the best common practice but can also take the most time.


9. What are the tools you have most commonly used to complete predictive analysis?  Which one is your favorite?   
Python Pandas dataFrame is by far my favorite tool. It is what I used to automate accounting anaytics predictions at Illinois State University,
financial automation at Douglas Capital Management, and predictive anaytics at Clark Street Capital. Douglas Capital Management 
used predicitve analytics with Python and I was preparing to do this but the project got put on major hold due to Covid19. 
I also love using Tablaeu because it is simple to use and has been well updated by Salesforce. Tablaeu gives a data scientist
an easy way to explain code to someone who may not have an intensive statistics and coding background.
