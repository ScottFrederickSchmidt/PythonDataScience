SimPy is a Python library that helps stimulate real-life events.
It is used as an active model for customers, vehicles, and manufacturing. 
An often used example other than a car is a restaurant:

'''
import simpy

def car(env):
    while True:
        print('Start parking at %d' % env.now)
        parking_duration = 5
        yield env.timeout(parking_duration)
        print('Start driving at %d' % env.now)
        trip_duration = 2
        yield env.timeout(trip_duration)

env = simpy.Environment()
env.process(car(env))
env.run(until=15)

Here is some premade code I found on this link:

'''

def waiter(env):
    while True: # Simulate until the time limit
        print(f"Start taking orders from customers at {env.now}")
        take_order_duration = 5
        yield env.timeout(take_order_duration) # models duration

        print(f'Start giving the orders to the cooks at {env.now}')
        give_order_duration = 2
        yield env.timeout(give_order_duration)

        print(f'Start serving customers food at {env.now}\n')
        serve_order_duration = 5
        yield env.timeout(serve_order_duration)

env = simpy.Environment() # the environment where the waiter lives
env.process(waiter(env)) # pass the waiter to the environment
env.run(until=30) # Run simulation until 30s

This is an example of using SimPy and generators to do a Movie Theater Simluation.
The goal is to get an average wait for 10 minutes or less.
The events are as follows:
1)Arrive at theater
2)Get in line to buy a ticket
3)Buy a ticket
4)Wait in line to have their ticket checked
5)Decide to buy concessiosn or not
