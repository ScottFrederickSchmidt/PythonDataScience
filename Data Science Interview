In Sept 2021, I applied for a Data Science position. I thought some questions were interesting and want to keep record of them for the future:
-------------------

Describe a specific situation in which you had to apply strong knowledge of SQL query language against a variety of data sets. (1600 characters maximum)*

I have one thousand hours of Python manipulation.





--------------------

Please detail where you gained knowledge of statistics and machine learning

Using portfolio123 is machine learning, by using a database of complex finance formulas to predict future returns. 





---------------------
Please describe a complex predictive model that you have developed

At Douglas Capital Management, we used a portfolio123 database to use hundreds of finance formulas to predict future returns. For instance,
 OperCashFlTTM - CapExTTM + IntExpTTM*(1-TaxRate%TTMInd/100) would be inserted into a database with a hundred other formulas to see which formula is the 
most relavant. Basic MATLAB functions would be used to help find the statistic relevance of each formula. In 2019 of Q4, our returns for our agressive trading 
were in the top 10. 

---------------------
What are the tools you have most commonly used to complete predictive analysis? (1600 characters maximum)*
